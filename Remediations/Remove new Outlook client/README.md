These are two scripts that can be used with Intune (Proactive) Remediation scripts to detect and remove the installation of the new Outlook (preview) client.
The detection script (NewOutlookClient_Detection.ps1) is run on the Windows client and detects the installation of the new Outlook client.
The remediation script (NewOutlookClient_Remediation.ps1) uninstalls the new Outlook client when this client is detected.
